## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[https://aasthas23.github.io/portfolio/]

I am Aastha Sheth, 19 years old. I am currently a computer science student at the University of Texas at Dallas. My fascination with computers and coding began in 5th grade, planting a seed of curiosity that has blossomed into a full-fledged passion. While those early years exposed me to the world of technology, it was in 10th grade that my interest truly exploded. This newfound passion fueled my decision to pursue a computer science degree. My journey doesn't stop at the classroom, I'm a firm believer in continuous learning
To further fuel my learning and gain valuable industry experience, I'm actively seeking an internship opportunity. I'm eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a collaborative and innovative environment, and I'm a fast learner who thrives in a challenging atmosphere.
