## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Aastha Sheth, 19 years old. I am currently a computer science student at the University of Texas at Dallas. My fascination with computers and coding began in 5th grade, planting a seed of curiosity that has blossomed into a full-fledged passion. While those early years exposed me to the world of technology, it was in 10th grade that my interest truly exploded. This newfound passion fueled my decision to pursue a computer science degree. My journey doesn't stop at the classroom. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning, and alongside my university studies, I'm actively pursuing certifications in cybersecurity and front-end development. These certifications not only enhance my skillset but also demonstrate my dedication to staying ahead of the curve. My ultimate goal is to delve deeper into back-end development, and I'm already setting my sights on the necessary learning and certifications to achieve this. Consistency is key, and it's what's propelling me forward on this exciting path.
To further fuel my learning and gain valuable industry experience, I'm actively seeking an internship opportunity. I'm eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a collaborative and innovative environment, and I'm a fast learner who thrives in a challenging atmosphere.
