 Hello! I'm Aastha!
 📚 A current student at UT Dallas, diving deep into Computer Science and loving every bit of it. I enjoy working with React, TypeScript, and anything frontend, but I’m also curious about full-stack development, APIs, and design. Whether it’s a solo build or a team effort, I love solving problems and bringing ideas to life. Always up for learning something new and working on cool projects with others!
